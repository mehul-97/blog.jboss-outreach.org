Hello Everyone! I’m going to talk about the Google Code-In, and the organization I’ve chosen: JBoss Community. Firstly, the GCI
is a competition for high school kids, they not only showcase their programming skills but their research and designing skills.
The GCI is not only about coding, you don’t need to be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs in order to win. There is an infinite 
number of tasks, some are categorized as beginner tasks and are a great way for you to learn about GCI tasks. You have tasks in
the categories of outreach, research, designing, documentation and of course, coding!

For me, the GCI is an exciting opportunity to learn about coding and full stack development, it inspires a kind of developer 
environment. The skills and experience you get from participating in a contest of such sheer immensity are infinitesimally
handy. I can use this competition to complete as many tasks as possible and to learn how to operate under deadlines, to pace 
myself and improve my programming skills. Only a week into the contest, and I’ve already improved on my earlier personality, 
I now know how to use GitHub and how to store objects in local storage, its a true, genuine learning experience.

My parent organization, JBoss Community, will also be vital in my learning experience. Till now, I’ve found the mentors 
extremely kind and helpful, they’ve taken less than 12 hours to reply to each of my queries. Till now, I’ve observed that 
JBoss Community promotes a special kind of environment, a challenging and competitive environment which I am sure will make this
competition even more interesting.
